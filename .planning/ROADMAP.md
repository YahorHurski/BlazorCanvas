## Phases

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.0 MinVP (Phases 1–5) — SHIPPED 2026-07-17</summary>

- [x] **Phase 1: Database, Schema & Geometry Core** (6/6 plans) — completed 2026-07-15
      Postgres 17 in Docker, the two-table schema whose CHECKs enforce the geometry, and the tested
      clamp/normalise/circle maths.
- [x] **Phase 2: Login, Session & Logout** (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-07-15
      Static-SSR login, cookie auth with the `user_id` claim, and an authenticated shell surviving F5.
- [x] **Phase 3: The Canvas & Drawing** (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-07-16
      The 1280×720 SVG at (0,48), the six-button toolbar, and drawing all four shapes — persisted.
- [x] **Phase 4: Select, Drag & Delete** (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-07-16
      The three verbs complete: 3px click-vs-drag, edge clamping that slides, and a Delete button.
- [x] **Phase 5: Live Cross-Tab Sync** (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-07-17
      The notifier, the real-time drag glide, and the consistency rules that stop any screen lying.

**Definition of done — met:**

> "I can log in, draw all four shapes, drag and delete them, open the app on a second monitor, and
> watch a figure GLIDE in real time as I drag it on the first — with everything surviving a refresh."

Verified by end-to-end code trace (v1.0 milestone audit) and by live human verification on two real
screens (BC-05-05).

**v1.0: 5/5 phases, 23/23 plans, 15/15 requirements — milestone audit passed.**

## What's Next

**Nothing planned.** BlazorCanvas is a deliberately terminal MinVP — `docs/DECISIONS.md` states that
anything not named there is out of scope until it is added **by name**. There is no v2 requirement
set. A future milestone would begin by amending the ADR, not by planning phases.

Known tech debt (~11 low-severity items from `01-REVIEW.md`) is recorded in
[`milestones/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`](milestones/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md). None blocks a
requirement.
