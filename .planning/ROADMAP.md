## Phases

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.0 MinVP (Phases 1–5) — SHIPPED 2026-07-17</summary>

- [x] **Phase 1: Database, Schema & Geometry Core** (6/6 plans) — completed 2026-07-15
      Postgres 17 in Docker, the two-table schema whose CHECKs enforce the geometry, and the tested
      clamp/normalise/circle maths.

- [x] **Phase 2: Login, Session & Logout** (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-07-15
      Static-SSR login, cookie auth with the `user_id` claim, and an authenticated shell surviving F5.

- [x] **Phase 3: The Canvas & Drawing** (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-07-16
      The 1280×720 SVG at (0,48), the six-button toolbar, and drawing all four shapes — persisted.

- [x] **Phase 4: Select, Drag & Delete** (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-07-16
      The three verbs complete: 3px click-vs-drag, edge clamping that slides, and a Delete button.

- [x] **Phase 5: Live Cross-Tab Sync** (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-07-17
      The notifier, the real-time drag glide, and the consistency rules that stop any screen lying.

**Definition of done — met:**

> "I can log in, draw all four shapes, drag and delete them, open the app on a second monitor, and
> watch a figure GLIDE in real time as I drag it on the first — with everything surviving a refresh."

Verified by end-to-end code trace (v1.0 milestone audit) and by live human verification on two real
screens (BC-05-05).

<summary>✅ v1.1 Canvas resize · selection UX · no-JS removal (Phases 6–8) — SHIPPED 2026-07-21</summary>

**Milestone goal:** Enlarge the canvas to 1472 × 828 (no migration, no shrink path); fix and restyle
figure selection (armed-tool persistence after a draw, exactly one figure selected at a time, a
topmost blue+white dashed trace replacing the red outline); and formally remove the project's
"no hand-authored JavaScript" constraint (doc-only — no runtime change, no new JS written).

- [x] **Phase 6: Canvas Resize to 1472×828** (1/1 plans) — completed 2026-07-21
      `CanvasBounds`-driven rendering at the enlarged surface, no migration, geometry edge tests
      re-pinned to the new inclusive bounds.

- [x] **Phase 7: Selection Lifecycle & Restyle** (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-07-21
      Armed-tool persistence after drawing, one-selection-at-a-time deselect rules, and a topmost
      blue+white dashed `SelectionTrace` replacing the red outline — human-verified live, including
      the two-tab remote-delete edge.

- [x] **Phase 8: Architecture Constraint Cleanup** (1/1 plans) — completed 2026-07-21
      The retired JavaScript policy reconciled across ADR, project summary, and derived constraint;
      D-06/D-18/D-33/D-37/D-57 motivations corrected to MVP simplicity. Documentation-only.

**Outcome:** 4/4 requirements validated (CANV-03, SEL-01, SEL-02, ARCH-01). All 3 phases verified
`passed`. 11 source/test files changed (+106/−60); `dotnet build` clean, 405/405 tests passing.

## Requirement Coverage

| Phase | Milestone | Requirements |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | v1.0 | DATA-02, TEST-01 |
| 2 | v1.0 | AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03 |

| 7 | v1.1 | SEL-01, SEL-02 |
| 8 | v1.1 | ARCH-01 |

**v1.0: 15/15 requirements mapped. v1.1: 4/4 requirements mapped. No orphans. No duplicates.**

## What's Next

**No milestone is active.** v1.1 shipped 2026-07-21; there are no open phases and no
`REQUIREMENTS.md` (a fresh one is created when the next milestone is opened).

**v1.2 is scoped, not started:** new figure types (ellipse, 5-point star, hexagon, pentagon,
right-angle triangle L/R, four arrows) + a dynamic split-button toolbar. Full plan:
`.planning/backlog/v1.2-figures-and-toolbar.md`. Its decision amendments happen when v1.2 is kicked
off — run `/gsd-new-milestone` to open it (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap).

Known v1.0 tech debt (~11 low-severity items from `01-REVIEW.md`) is recorded in
[`milestones/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`](milestones/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md). None blocks a
requirement. v1.1 added no new tech debt.
